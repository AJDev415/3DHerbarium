        This is the <b>official</b> fork of the world's first 3D Digital Herbarium! Originally developed by AJ Bealum and his team of student assistants 
        at the Cal Poly Humboldt Library,
        the 3D Digital Herbarium is an innovative educational platform dedicated to bringing the intricate world of botany to life through state-of-the-art 3D modeling.
        At the heart of our mission is the desire to transform how students learn about flora, transcending traditional boundaries by offering an immersive,
        interactive experience. Our 3D Digital Herbarium is a unique resource, meticulously designed for botany students and enthusiasts alike.
        It features a diverse collection of flora, each represented in stunning three-dimensional detail.
        These models offer an unparalleled opportunity to study and appreciate the intricate structures and characteristics of various plant species,
        providing a level of detail that far surpasses what&apos;s available in textbooks or two-dimensional images.

        Since its inception, the 3D Digital Herbarium has garnered significant attention and support, including funding from the Institue of Museums and Libraries (IMLS) and recognition through awards such as the ALA RUSA Best Emerging Tech Award in 2024.
        These accolades underscore the project&apos;s impact and its potential to revolutionize botanical education.

      <p>Beyond merely viewing, our platform allows users to interact with these models, rotating and examining plants from every angle.
        This hands-on approach facilitates a deeper understanding of plant morphology and taxonomy, making it an invaluable tool for education and research.
        Looking towards the future, our vision extends beyond botany.
        We plan to evolve 3dherbarium.net into a general comprehensive 3D learning platform.
        This expansion will encompass an array of subjects, offering 3D models that cater to a wide spectrum of academic fields and interests.
